Python data types(objects)
- Iterable : list, tuple, dictionary, string, set
- Sequence : list, tuple, string
- Mutable  : list, dictionary, set, user-defined class
- Imutable : int, float, decimal, bool, string, tuple, range, unicode

Python hierarchy
- Module is a file which contains various Python functions and global variables. It is simply just .py extension file which has python executable code.
- Package is a collection of modules. It must contains an __init__.py file as a flag so that the python interpreter processes it as such. The __init__.py could be an empty file without causing issues.
- Library is a collection of packages.
- Framework is a collection of libraries. This is the architecture of the program.
- Application is an application.


Tip
When using print statment, in string you don't have to order your format specifier.
print("{2} {0} {1}".format(num1, num2, num3)) ----> this is totally fine.
print("{} {} {}".format(num1, num2, num3)) ----> this also is totally fine.

Terminology
- division operation : dividend / divisor = quotient + remainder
- PEMDAS(precedance of operation): parantheses exponent multiplication division addition substraction


List
List comprehension
[expression for item in iterable (if condition == True)]
# flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'
vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
[num for elem in vec for num in elem]

Set
intersection : set(a) & set(b)

Map
